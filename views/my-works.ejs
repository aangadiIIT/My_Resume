            Juniper has its own git repositories, and before committing the code, we run job in pipeline, and it performs the checkout, 
            applies patch, does build and run test scripts for the job. This automated process to reduce the time of the developers to 
            perform build and test on their code we use this tool. Once the successful build and test is done the tool triggers the code 
            for commit in the repos.

            Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach aligning with Software Studio 3.0 in which teams keep producing 
            valuable software in short cycles and ensure that the software can be reliably released at any time. It is used in software 
            development to automate and improve the process of software delivery. Techniques such as automated testing and continuous 
            integration (CI) allow software to be developed to a high standard and easily packaged and deployed to test environments, 
            resulting in the ability to rapidly, reliably and repeatedly push out enhancements and bugfixes to customers at low risk and 
            with minimal manual overhead.Juniper has its own git repositories, and before committing the code, we run job in pipeline,

          <p class="work-description">
            This project focuses on development of a system which can monitor temperature, humidity, moisture level of different crops in 
            agricultural field. It helps in saving and conserving the water by automatically providing the water to the plant according to 
            their respective water requirement. The system has a distributed network for soil- moisture and temperature sensors placed in 
            the fields to pump the water according to its requirement. This project requires IoT sensors, WiFi modem, PHP and HTML.

            <p class="work-description">
                Real-life Problem faced by the people is that due to their busy schedule, they often forget and lose their important materials. 
                So, by using Object Finder Android App with BLE connectivity we find the objects or person or even an animal.
